# Dev Profile — richer dev verification, flexibly (a §6A preset)

## 1. Activation (dev-only, never forced)

- **Auto-detect (advisory)**: dev markers in repo root — `package.json`, `go.mod`,
  `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, etc. Presence →
  *suggest* the dev profile at PHASE 0. Detection only suggests.
- **Explicit**: the local config (`docs/CONVENTION.md` or `## cowork-sprint scope`
  in `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`) sets `profile: dev` (or `none`, or a future
  `marketing`/`research`).
- **Override always wins.** The user/config decides; auto-detect never auto-applies
  without the PHASE 0 approval gate.
- Non-dev sprints are untouched — the generic defaults (prd-to-gap chain) apply.

## 2. Complexity tier (suggested defaults, not gates)

Within dev, an optional tier scales ceremony. Tiers are *defaults* — any knob can
be flipped regardless of tier.

| tier | marker (default, overridable) | dev knobs on by default |
|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `light` | static site / single package | gap-analysis + mechanical baseline |
| `standard` | app with deps | + bounded-iterate, code+test pairing, intent anchor |
| `heavy` | k8s / terraform / multi-service | + plan scheduler, dataflow sub-lens, design-alternatives |

Detect → suggest → apply only after the PHASE 0 approval gate (consistent with the
existing approval gate; never silent auto-apply).

## 3. The knob bundle (what `profile: dev` switches on)

All are defaults. `profile` (#9) and `tier` (#10) are the §6A knobs that switch this
bundle on/scale it; the individual sub-defaults below (safetyMargin, plateau-K,
iterate cap, test depth, design-alternatives) are tunable via free-form local-config
keys — they are NOT each a numbered §6A knob. (§6A exposes #1–#10; only #9/#10 are
dev-specific.)

### 3.1 Intent Anchor propagation (Tier S)
The PRD-lite IS the anchor. Propagate its Problem + Success Metrics forward as the
intent contract every cycle phase and the intent-audit reference. Default suggested
fields = WHY / WHO / RISK / SUCCESS / SCOPE (PRD-lite knob #1) — add/drop freely.
No separate presence gate; the anchor is just the PRD-lite step carried forward.

### 3.2 Gap-analysis dev lens (Tier S)
Adds dev signals to the QA Axis-2 gap-analysis (references/gap-analysis.md § Dev
lens): placeholder/stub detection (→ classify `partial`, not `done`), 3-way
contract agreement (spec ↔ server ↔ client) when an API exists, "evidence must be
real depth, not a file that exists" (anti-gaming). On top of these signals, a dev
sprint scores each item across the applicable **multi-axis reference** (Structural/
Functional/Contract/Intent/Behavioral/UX/Runtime — gap-analysis.md § Multi-axis
scoring): applying the multi-axis discipline is the dev default (NOT opt-in), while
WHICH axes apply adapts to the environment (drop UX with no UI, Runtime only when a
run is possible, redistribute — never silently zero). The matchRate aggregation
method stays knob #4 (flat vs priority-weighted); the axis SET is adapted per work,
never blindly hardcoded.

### 3.3 Plan scheduler (Tier S, generic)
OFFERS (does not force) a deterministic scheduler in PHASE 0: given the feature
list + dependency graph →
1. **topological sort** (Kahn) by dependency edges; detect cycles and report them.
2. **greedy bin-packing** into sprints under a budget:
   `effectiveBudget = maxPerSprint × (1 − safetyMargin)` (default margin 0.25).
3. a single feature exceeding the budget → its own sprint, flagged `oversized`.
4. compute cross-sprint `dependsOn` edges from the original graph.

Estimator is **pluggable** — default coarse size buckets (S/M/L → rough token
weight), NOT LOC-locked; a repo may swap in a token-guess estimator (decision §6.1).
The Leader may accept, tweak, or ignore the suggested grouping — it is an aid, not a
verdict. Keep synthesis vs side-effects separate: the grouping math is deterministic
Leader work, not an LLM guess.

### 3.4 Cycle safety: measure-then-advance + auto-pause (Tier S)
Two disciplines, both as principles + overridable defaults:
- **Measure before you advance** — never treat an *unmeasured* gate as failed.
  Applies to the two-axis QA gate: if Axis-2 matchRate is not yet measured, that is
  `not_measured` (go measure it), distinct from `measured-and-below-threshold`
  (fail → fix loop). Conflating the two deadlocks the sprint.
- **Auto-pause conditions** (cowork already arms these in SKILL.md Gates):
  quality regressed / iterate cap hit / budget blown / phase hung. The dev profile
  supplies default **thresholds** (e.g. budget/time bounds), which are tunable — but
  the trigger SET itself is fixed safety (SKILL.md Gates lists the canonical fixed
  set). You tune the thresholds, not which safety triggers are armed.

### 3.5 Tier A (default-on for standard+; all optional)
- **Bounded iterate**: cap N (default 5) + **plateau detection** (stop after 2
  rounds of no matchRate improvement) + anti-gaming guard ("don't add
  comments/stubs to inflate the score").
- **L1-L5 test vocabulary** for the Axis-1 baseline (unit / api / e2e / ux /
  dataflow) with **graceful degradation** (skip levels the stack can't run, note
  the skip). Guidance, not a required matrix.
- **code+test pairing**: an impl WorkList item with no test → gap-analysis classes
  it `partial`. Default-on standard+; off-able.
- **Design alternatives**: when a design doc is produced, *suggest* ≥2 considered
  approaches + rationale. A nudge in the design step, never a gate.

### 3.6 Sub-lenses / opt-in (respecting openness)
- **7-layer dataFlow** (web-fullstack only): offered under the dataflow knob as
  "trace one end-to-end write path", with the hops UI→Client→API→Validation→DB→
  Response→UI as an *example* checklist. Not a default.
- **Layer-purity lint** (e.g. a `lib/domain/` no-IO check): optional dev lint a
  repo can enable; never an imposed source structure.
- **bkend.ai skills**: only behind an explicit "uses bkend.ai" sub-flag.

## 4. Dev agent legion (vendored) + persona mechanisms

Under `profile: dev` the Leader has a **vendored dev-agent legion** in `agents/`
(Apache-2.0 from bkit, vendored — no bkit install needed; see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
They join cowork's normal discovery pool; profile:dev just means the Leader reaches
for them at the right moment ("you don't have to know — the right expert is dispatched").

**Verification (read-only review) — dispatch in the cycle's review/QA/gate steps:**
- `gap-detector` — QA **Axis-2 fresh-perspective reviewer**: classify each WorkList
  item done/partial/missing/divergent → matchRate (the §3.2 dev lens executor).
- `code-analyzer` — code quality / security / perf, **confidence ≥80 gating** + severity.
- `design-validator` — pre-`do` design completeness gate (don't build on an incomplete spec).
- `security-architect` — OWASP / security lens, esp. at the irreversible/deploy gate.

**Test (Tier A L1-L5) — dispatch in QA Axis-1 when tests are in scope:**
- `qa-test-planner` → `qa-test-generator` — design → L1-L5 plan (JSON) → runnable tests
  (framework auto-detected), with graceful degradation.
- `qa-debug-analyst` — when a runtime failure needs to be made observable: designs
  structured logging + traces the failing path to a cited root cause. Runtime-agnostic
  (no docker assumption); use the log surfaces the stack actually has.

**Builders — dispatch by the work's domain (heavy tier mostly):**
- `frontend-architect` (UI / components / design-system) · `infra-architect`
  (cloud / K8s / Terraform / CI-CD) · `enterprise-expert` (architecture strategy,
  go/no-go, 3-prerequisite self-gate).
- `bkend-expert` — **OPTIONAL, only when the project uses bkend.ai BaaS** (gated; do not
  dispatch otherwise).

**Sprint personas absorbed as MECHANISM (not shipped agents):**
| bkit persona | absorbed as |
|--------------|-------------|
| sprint-master-planner | §3.3 plan scheduler (PHASE 0 + sprint-method.md) |
| sprint-orchestrator | §3.4 cycle-safety (measure-then-advance + auto-pause) |
| sprint-qa-flow | §3.6 dataflow sub-lens (gap-analysis dev lens) |
| sprint-report-writer | carry-item rule (matchRate<100 → carry) — already in cowork report |

Principle kept from bkit: **pure-synthesis isolation** — a vendored agent returns
content; deterministic work (scheduling math, state writes, gate evaluation) stays
with the Leader/procedure. This already matches cowork's "Leader coordinates, work is
delegated." The vendored agents are also self-evolvable per cowork's normal rules
(they are owned project-local scaffolds once vendored).

## 5. What this profile deliberately does NOT bring
Fixed 9-phase enum, M1-M10 numeric SSoT, `.bkit/` checkpoint store, CI invariants,
token-ledger, enforced Clean-Architecture source layout — all against the
lightweight/open stance. Absorbed as principles where useful, never as mandates.

## 6. Dev methodology (absorbed principles — all defaults, not mandates)

bkit codifies a dev philosophy; cowork absorbs the *principles*, expressed cowork-style
(knob + default, never a hard process):

- **Context Engineering** — give each cycle phase exactly the context it needs, when it
  needs it (not the whole history). cowork already does research-before-do + intent
  anchor; under dev: feed `do` the design doc + the WorkList slice it touches, feed
  review the gap result, feed intent-audit the PRD Success Metrics — not everything
  everywhere. (This is also why the vendored agents are read-only/scoped.)
- **Docs=Code (design-first, enforced by gap)** — the design doc is the contract;
  `gap-detector` (vendored) enforces design↔implementation agreement at QA Axis-2.
  Code that diverges from the design without updating it is a gap (`divergent`), not `done`.
- **Convention-first** — establish a shared glossary + conventions BEFORE building
  (bkit phase-1/2 idea), so every dispatched agent emits consistent, on-vocabulary code.
  Default: a lightweight `docs/` glossary + conventions note at PHASE 0 for multi-feature
  dev sprints; skip for trivial. Knob-able.
- **Quality-gate pack (the "11")** — bkit's M1-M10 + S1 offered as a dev DEFAULT bundle,
  each a tunable knob, none a hard mandate: matchRate (#3), critical-issues = 0,
  convention compliance, design completeness, API compliance, success-criteria coverage,
  dataflow integrity. Measured by the vendored verification agents; evaluated
  measure-then-advance (§3.4). A repo dials thresholds or disables gates via local config.
- **Trust-based autonomy** — how far a sprint auto-runs scales with *earned* trust
  (gate-pass / low-rollback streak), not a fixed flag. cowork already has autorun scope;
  under dev a clean streak widens it, a failure narrows it. Default conservative; never
  auto-escalates past the approval gate.

## 7. Architecture lenses (optional, dev)

Offered as optional dev lenses — never an imposed source structure (openness stance):
- **Clean Architecture** — optional lint: business logic free of IO/framework imports
  (e.g. a `domain/` no-`fs`/`http` check). Enable per repo; cowork imposes no layout.
- **API-First** — when an API is in scope, converge the contract (endpoints, shapes,
  errors) in the design doc BEFORE implementing; `gap-detector`'s 3-way contract check
  (spec↔server↔client) then verifies it. A nudge, not a gate.
- **7-Layer dataflow verification** — the web-fullstack dataflow sub-lens (§3.6): trace
  UI→Client→API→Validation→DB→Response→UI as an *example* end-to-end checklist (opt-in;
  non-web dev traces its own end-to-end path). Executed by `gap-detector` / a runtime probe.
